                        <img class="img img-thumbnail" id="Me" src="IMG_9015.JPG"> Ashante, a California native, is a mother
                        of three wonderful boys and the eldest of three girls. She had many dreams and aspirations, which
                        she was able to accomplish most of them. At the age of 17 years old, she joined United States Army
                        Reserves and served for 8 years. As time progressed, she moved to Atlanta and decided to pursue her
                        Bachelor's degree. In addition, she explored a career in the Payroll Industry and eventually became
                        an Implementation Consultant for her employer's Project Services department. In 2009, Ashante completed
                        her Bachelor's degree and earned her Certified Payroll Professional certificate. In 2011, Ashante
                        decided to go back to school for her Master's degree in Project Management, which she completed the
                        following year.

                    <p>
                        Ashante has had many fun experiences, such acting, becoming a fitness instructor and performing at an Atlanta Hawks game,
                        to name a few. Even in all of those experiences, she finds joy in being a mother to her 3 sons. She
                        has found time in her busy schedule to volunteer for their sports programs. Just recently, Ashante
                        decided to enroll into UCLA Extension's Coding Bootcamp program, where she will learn to code computers,
                        in hopes of expanding her knowledge and giving her sons a skillset that will benefit them in the
                        years to come.
